                  --------------


Solve 
-----
Beware of producing duplicate constraints between meetings, i.e. a duplicate for
each agent attending a meeting. This will not just affect the cost of propagation 
it may also affect the behaviour of heuristics. 

Beware of meetings that are unconstrained. This might result in associated variables
NOT being added into the solver. This can cause a crash when solutions are outputted

Optimize
--------
Optimize is a small edit distance from Solve. The basic requirement is to minimise the maximum meeting time. 

Beware of leaving the problem over-constrained. An example is problem10. It cannot be scheduled in the timeslots 
given therefore we need to find the smallest amount of additional time required. Generally we can compute
an upper bound as a sequential schedule of meetings (no concurrency) with a travel distance between 
meetings taken to be the greatest distance in the distance matrix. 


Report
------
The report should include a description of the model, description of heuristics, 
computational study, consideration of alternative model.

In the description of heuristics do not summarise the description of the heuristics used
in the choco manual. Give a description of the heuristics in the context given. For example, 
what does smallest domain first mean in this setting, and what does dom-over-deg mean in this 
setting?

In the computational study consider implementing a job that will execute your experiments and produce results
that you can easily analyse and present (tabulate and/or summarise).
